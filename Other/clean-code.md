# Clean Code

Variables:

* Variables should describe what they do, not how they do it
* Name magic numbers
* Use object and array destructuring
* Good variable names help avoid the use of comments

Functions:

* Keep them small
* Move conditional logic to a new function instead of having a long if statement conditional
* Read top to bottom
* Limit the number of parameters

Comments:

* If the code is readable, you don't need comments
* Don't use comments to explain bad code
* Good comments are concise and provide value and clarifications
